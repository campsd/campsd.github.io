abstract = {Pole-swapping algorithms, generalizations of bulge-chasing algorithms, have been shown to be a viable alternative to the bulge-chasing QZ algorithm for solving the generalized eigenvalue problem for a matrix pencil A−λB. It is natural to try to devise a pole-swapping algorithm that solves the standard eigenvalue problem for a single matrix A. This paper introduces such an algorithm and shows that it is competitive with Francis's bulge-chasing QR algorithm.}
